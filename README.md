# ScrabbleSolver
A personal project to improve my webdev / JS skills

They claim I can do webdev at work, but I'm not so sure.

This simple project will allow me to learn the following:

* **Node:** I've only ever had a Node server pre-setup for me. Time to fix that.
* **Grids:** Not sure if grids are the correct solution here, but the 15x15 grid of a scrabble board can probably be squeezed into a grid system. No more HTML3 table practices for this guy.
* **OOP in JS:** Likely need to have objects to set up the Scrabble system.

Goals of the solver itself are "simple" (it's actually really complex...):
* Solve for the highest possible score on a turn with a given a hand.

Possible expansions of the solver:
* "Card Counting", basically see statistically what the chances are you're assisting an opponent. Make opportune choices based on it.
* Looking a turn ahead. Do we want to keep certain pieces this turn based on a high likelihood of a high score play next turn?


Due to the processing needs of such a problem I'm not even sure this is possible to do in JS, but I'm going to give it a shot. No matter what I will learn something.
